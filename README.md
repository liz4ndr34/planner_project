# Project Title
The Planner

#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/YkDezBbubAY>

#### Description:
The application is a planner where the user can register and log in. The user can add tasks of daily life and see a to-do list after the task has been added. There are options for period and task type to select when adding a new task. The user can visualize the to-do list by the present day, week, and month.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python
* Flask
* SQL
* Jinja
* Bootstrap
* HTML
* CSS

## Setup
To run this project, open the Terminal, and write:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Then activate Scripts:

```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate
```
Then in Visual Studio Code click on View and in Command Palette, select Python Interpreter, then select the venv file in the project folder and click on Select Interpreter.

Then update Python, write the following in the Terminal:

```bash
python -m pip install â€“-upgrade pip
```

Once upgraded, the app can be run with Flask with the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
python3 -m flask --app ./app.py run
```

## Features
- Create an account
- Create task
- Visualize tasks

## How the app works?
Once the user is on the app, the user can register. During the registration, the user will need to enter these fields:
* Name
* Username
* E-mail
* Password
* Password confirmation

In the Register route, the app checks that all fields are complete and that the password and password confirmation match.
With the password is generated a hash. With all the previous fields and the hash, the registration information is stored in the Users table, and a new user is created.

After the registration of the user, the user must go to the login page and log into the app.

The login route checks that the username and the password must be complete, then the username and password are checked and if valid, the user can enter the app.

In the app, the user can see the list of tasks per day and change the view by week or month.

In order to add tasks to these lists, the user will need to go to the Add Task page. On the page, the user will need to enter these fields:
* Title of the task
* When will be the task
* Type of the task

With these fields completed, in the plan route, the information of these fields is inserted into the Tasks table, so the user can see the tasks added grouped by today's tasks, week or month.

## Project Status
Project is complete.

## Room for Improvement
The app has room for improvement.

Room for improvement:
- Add edit and delete task options
- Add dashboards with filters

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by CS50 finance project
- This project was based on the idea of translating a paper to-do list into an app. As at work I usually start the day by planning the day or the week.
- Many thanks to the CS50 team and teacher for all the knowledge shared

## Lessons Learned
With this project I learned how to set up app development locally and work outside of the CS50 code space, which was a challenge at the beginning, but after researching and reading the documentation I was able to work locally. Another lesson learned from the project is to test and increase features one by one as it is better when fixing bugs.
